# Contributing guide

The platform used to host the project docs has changed throughout time with the objective of making sure everything is easy to read and edit. We've settled on MkDocs with a customized Material for MkDocs theme hosted on GitHub Pages. Any changes made here will be reflected on [docs.rigsofrods.org](docs.rigsofrods.org).

## New contributor guide

To get an overview, read the [README](README.md).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Reporting a problem

There's several ways to approach making changes to the docs, but the most important is opening an issue. If you spot a problem, it's important to open an issue after making sure another related issue isn't already open. You can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form]().

#### Resolving issues

You can go through our existing issues and find one that interests you.

### Making changes

#### Make changes in the UI

If you spot a problem that doesn't require an issue being opened such as a typo, broken link, or bad grammar then you should click. This will take you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request]() for review. 

#### Make changes in your own workspace

You'll need a couple things to get your workspace setup:

1. Install MkDocs
2. Install Git (or GitHub Desktop)
3. Fork the repository
4. Create a working branch in your forked repository

You can use your code editor of preference, but most people nowadays use VS Code.

### Coding style

We use Markdown for our docs, which means you will very rarely ever need to touch an HTML or CSS file as [every element needed is already built-in](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). 

Somethings you should keep in mind when working with a `.md` file:

* The title of the doc
* 

These docs have gone through years of changes, so older parts of the docs tend to contain a lot of HTML and inline CSS.
