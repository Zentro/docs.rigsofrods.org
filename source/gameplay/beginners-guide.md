# Beginner's Guide

**Rigs of Rods is not beginner friendly. Referencing this guide now and then is to be expected.** But don't be discouraged! This guide aims to cover practically everything you need to get up and running as quickly as possible.

## Installation

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## Getting started

When you launch Rigs of Rods for the first time you may see a very tiny window. Depending on your monitor's resolution, this can be incredibly tiny, but don't worry you'll be able to adjust the resolution.

### Setup and personalization

Before doing anything, it's suggested you adjust the resolution to match your monitor's resolution (i.e. 1920x1080 or 1366x768) but do not set it to anything more than what your monitor is capable of.  **Doing so may cause an Internal Error, which will require you to delete your `config` folder from the User Directory.**

You may also want to make some adjustments to the graphics settings to be better optimized for your PC. However, the settings provided should be sufficient. Also, keep in mind that DirectX is proprietary Windows software. If you're on Linux, you will only have the option to use OpenGL.

Restart Rigs of Rods to apply any changes you've made.

### Selector

Select `Single player` and you'll be prompted with the **Selector**. With the **Selector** you'll be asked to select a terrain to load. By default, you may not have that many terrains. You might not even have more than 4! This is fine and for the sake of time, select `North St Helens`. It may take a while to load, but when you do load you'll spawn as a guy lovingly referred to as RoRBot (you cannot refer to RoRBot as anything else, no one will know what you're talking about!).

## User Interface

Let's get familiar with the **User Interface** of Rigs of Rods.

### Top Menu Bar

It's hidden, but try moving your cursor to the topmost part of the screen and it should appear. Let's start with the most prominent things, `Simulation` and `Vehicles`.

Under `Simulation`, you can alter various aspects of a scene with the most important being `Get new vehicle` which will open the spawner and `Remove all vehicles` which will remove all spawned vehicles in your scene.

### Spawner

We're interested in `Get new vehicle`, which is where you can open the **Spawner** and start trying out different types of vehicles. (Note that you may also access the spawner through the key bind ++ctrl+g++ or through various parts of a terrain)

## Controls

This guide assumes that you are playing with *keyboard only*. As such, most keyboard controls will be covered in this guide. For more details, see the [Controls Guide](controls.md).

Your **User Directory** can be found at `Documents\My Games\Rigs of Rods` on :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows and `~/.rigsofrods` on :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux (or with Snap Store `~/snap/rigs-of-rods/common/`).
