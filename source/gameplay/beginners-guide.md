# Beginner's Guide

**Rigs of Rods is not beginner friendly.** 

## Installation

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## Getting started

When you launch Rigs of Rods for the first time, a couple things happen in the background. If you look in `Documents\My Games\Rigs of Rods` on Windows or `~/.rigsofrods` on Linux, you will see a couple folders such as `cache`, `config`, `logs`, `mods`, `savegames`, and `screenshots`. This is called your **User Directory**, and you don't need to worry about it just yet. Apart from what happens in the background, a small window will open at the default resolution of 800 x 600. This may be incredibly small depending on your monitor's resolution, so to fix this we'll need to explore `Settings` and get you setup.

### Setup

`Render system` by default will be `Direct3D9` on Windows or `OpenGL` on Linux. If you're on Linux, you will not see an option for DirectX 9 as Direct X is for Windows only. Where you should draw your attention to is `Video Mode` and you will see that the default is `800 x 600`. Change `Video Mode` to the real resolution of your monitor (i.e. 1920 x 1080) but do not set it to anything above what your monitor is capable of. **Doing so may cause an Internal Error, which will require you to delete your `config` folder from the User Directory.** 

Next, you should make your way to `Graphics`. You can make any adjustments to the video settings to be better optimized for your PC. However, the defaults should be sufficient.

### Selector

Select `Single player` and you'll be prompted with the **Selector**. What is it? Well, it's where you select things (duh)! With the **Selector** you'll be asked to select a terrain to load. By default, you may not have that many terrains. Heck, you may not even have more than 4! This is fine and for the sake of time, select `North St Helens`. It may take a while to load, but when you do load you'll spawn as a guy lovingly refered to as RoRBot (you cannot refer to RoRBot as anything else, no one will know what you're talking about!).

### User Directory

* `cache`
* `logs`
* `mods`
* `savegames`
* `screenshots`

## User Interface

Congratulations, you've made it this far. Keep going! Now that you've spawned, it's time to start 

### Top Menu Bar

It's hidden! But if you kindly ask it to appear, it will. Try moving your cursor to the topmost part of the screen and it should appear. Let's start with the most prominent things, `Simulation` and `Vehicles`.

Under `Simulation`, you can alter various aspects of a scene with the most important being `Get new vehicle` which will open the spawner and `Remove all vehicles` which will remove all spawned vehicles in your scene.

### Spawner

We're interested in `Get new vehicle`, which is where you can open the **Spawner** and start trying out different types of vehicles. (Note that you may also access the spawner through the key bind CTRL+G or through various parts of a terrain)

### Friction
