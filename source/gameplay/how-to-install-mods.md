# How to install mods

## The simple way <small>recommended</small> { #the-simple-way data-toc-label="The simple way" }

Starting with Rigs of Rods 2022.04, you can now use the handy **Repository Manager** as if you were using a browser. Similiar to a browser, you can select the type, search, and sort through the entire repository. When you find a mod you like, simply select it and click `Install`. Didn't like the mod you installed? You can remove it by clicking `Remove`. If you're having trouble with a mod click `Reinstall`.

!!! warning "Are you sure you want to discard any changes you've made?"
	Any changes you make WILL NOT be saved if you decide to uninstall, reinstall, or update a mod.

!!! info "Keep in mind some limitations"
	As of Rigs of Rods 2022.04, only the `mods` folder will be detected and used. However, it is a planned feature to allow different folder destinations.

The default location of your `mods` folder can be found in the **User Directory**. You will place your `*.zip` inside the `mods` folder by copy (CTRL+C) and paste (CTRL+V) or drag and drop. If you can also organize your `mods` folder by creating subfolders where you may want to sort by type.

That's it! Now you should be able to launch Rigs of Rods and enjoy!

### on Linux

With Linux, the default location where your `mods` folder is `~/.rigsofrods`. This is a hidden folder. Mind you, if you installed Rigs of Rods through Snap, the default location is `~/snap/rigs-of-rods/common/`. Drag and drop or `mv` the `*.zip` inside the `mods` folder, this may vary depending on your Linux distribution.

You can also organize your `mods` folder by creating subfolders.

That's it! Launch Rigs of Rods and enjoy!

## What to avoid

### Extracting Zips

Unless its specified to do so, you **CANNOT** extract a mod into the mods folder. Doing so will break other mods.
