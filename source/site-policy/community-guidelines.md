# Community Guidelines

As with any community, rules and guidelines are important to keep order

Access to the community is a privilege, not a right, and members who continually breach these rules and guidelines will find themselves limited or removed from the community, regardless of the other contributions they have made.

## Engaging with other members
### Be courteous and respect other members
Treat others how you would like to be treated. You will not make personal attacks, aggressive messages, and passive-aggressive behavior is unacceptable. If you are unable to reply to another member in a civilized and constructive way, you should ignore them. It is in your best interest.

Avoid making religious or political remarks as these may spur toxicity with other members who have differing views.

### It does not have to be written in the rules to be a rule
Do not be a rules lawyer. Just because it is not written here, does not make it OK.

### Do not backseat moderate
Do not backseat moderate. If you see something that is in clear violation, don't worry, a staff member will see it soon and take action. If you see no action taken, make use of the Report button to bring it to the attention of a staff member.

If a discussion has turned toxic, do not participate in it. You are asked to ignore it and let staff handle it. If you participate, you will be treated equally as culpable.

### Do not beg
Begging is rude. Nobody is paid for what they do here. Everyone is a volunteer. Sometimes a really cool project may be done quickly, done slowly, or never finish.

Remember, people who volunteer their time owe you nothing. We ask that you do not make demands with volunteers.

This does not mean, however, that making a suggestion is prohibited. You are free to offer suggestions and offer constructive criticism.

### Do not post anything that isn't constructive
If you see that a thread has not been replied to for longer than a couple months, do not reply to it. This is considered thread bumping. Make a new thread.

Simply replying with "BUMP!" to your own to make it get more attention is also considered thread bumping.

When replying to a thread, do not reply with a couple of words like "LOL!" or "thanks". This will be considered spam.

When quoting, do not quote an entire thread. This is excessive and unnecessary and also considered spam.

Try not to manually add a signature in your posts. There is already a feature for this.

### Try searching for what you are looking for before asking
Do a simple Google search of what you're looking for before asking your question. You may find what you're looking for was already found by another member or that your question has already been answered.

### English only
English is the primary language.

### Try to use proper grammar
Typing in all caps will be considered spam.

It's understandable if English isn't your first language, but please make sure what you type is readable.

### One account per person. One person per account.
If you have an account already, do not make another. It will be deleted.

If you forgot the password to your account, please use the Password recovery button.
